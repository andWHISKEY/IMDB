The story is dazzling action-packed politically aware and brilliant. As good or better than Sin City. The actors many of whom (sigh) I am not familiar with are brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley practically picks the film up bodily and carries it. The direction is not merely good it is perfect. Even the sound track seems to move the story along. (And I am no fan of Zack Synder outside of this film. MAN OF STEEL was a sellout to the action crowd creating chaos out of order. Ditto Sucker Punch). But art is like that.

Lucas's Star Wars series. Met by the rather coldly stern gaze of critics the first film of the new trilogy can cause some confusion in the viewer. There are not many action scenes in it there are many dialogues and just a leisurely development of actions which sometimes may seem like a forced filler with a connecting function between fights and races. But this is only at first glance because if you look closely ... Young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) go to negotiations with the Trade Federation which threatens to blockade the peaceful little planet of Naboo. In Obi-Wan's eyes his mind and vision are already visible his movements are already full of courage and confidence. Confidence and powerful unquestioning dedication are seen in the young queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) that she is ready to do anything to help her people the inhabitants of the occupied world federation. It is in The Phantom Menace most accurately and correctly disclose the nature and fragile at the same time in BOGATYRSKY solid Padme: it is able to stand alone against the decision of the Senate venturing recklessly brave adventures and combine intuitive dictates of the heart with equanimity of mind. Qui-Gon Jin is unshakable and calm in whatever situation he was. His eyes radiate wisdom and strength a smile condescendingly reasonable and the movements are smooth and weighed. But the main feature of Obi-Wan's teacher is not in these of course the most important qualities. Qui-Gon first of all is a man of exceptional faith. Some of his actions seem too risky and thoughtless but somewhere in general they can be mistaken for a desperate bluff. But for him extremely sensitive to everything around him holding in an unsurpassed harmony the awareness of his own forces and the sense of difficulty of the tasks set for him who knows how to feel the situation on many many forward steps faith is the main tool. With her help he stands unshakably on his feet seeking his own by all means. Once having set a goal - to certainly train quite a young Anakin Skywalker - Qui-Gon will go to her persistently and steadily. He alone believes in the Prophecy of the great destiny of the boy as if he did not hear the fears of the Jedi Council that Anakin's uncertain future could pose great troubles to the Galaxy. But the foresight and the unique sense of Qui-Gon's world allow him to see far further than to his eminent like-minded people and mentors like Master Yoda and Master Windu. In addition an extraordinary faith allows Qui-Gon to destroy any of his fears and doubts that can obscure his clear eyes. The moment of the film is very important in which the wise Jedi tells Anakin about the medichlorians micro-organisms existing in symbiosis with the cells of any living organism. Perhaps in these mysterious media chlorians lies the human soul elusive to the eye and non-existent for touch. Then the wise counsel of Qui-Gon Jinn and unselfish greed deprived the boy Anakin Skywalker wanted to visit every planet in the universe it seems quite clear and sharp Go up to the call of the heart and you go on the right path. And even though this road is lost in the darkness of the gathering clouds there will always be someone who sees a little farther than everyone else and builds on this sagacity its most powerful faith. Qui-Gon believed in Anakin from the first second and believed in him to the end; most likely he understood the suffering and upheavals that promised further training of the boy for the Galaxy and for himself but in one thing he was certain that in the final analysis Skywalker would return the Force to equilibrium ... Finishing on the major note of universal jubilation and festivities Episode I: The Hidden Menace at first glance does not justify its mysterious and menacing title. But having looked a little closer we see that the holiday is just a calm before the storm and a sweet truce is a tricky tactical ploy. It also becomes clear with horror that all the actions of all the heroes are quite comparable with the freedom to choose the actions of puppets tied to strong threads for which someone is confidently pulling able to control the movements of dolls by the easy fingering. And the violent protest of Padme Amidaly at the Senate meeting and the murder of the mighty Darth Moule and the fiasco of the Trade Federation and the heroic death of Qui-Gon Gin are all foggings in the plan of the mysterious strategist who is still hiding far from the battlefields its galactic war. And Anakin Skywalker's aching lead heart which is filled with a burning drying fear after the death of a Jedi so much loved by him also lies in a small coin albeit of a larger value than the rest on a comprehensive battle map of the devilish clever and cunning puppeteer. The beginning of the saga is laid the heroes are represented the plot knots are tied. Star Wars Beginning</td></tr><tr><td>BiiivAL</td><td>0121765</td><td>8</td><td>2018-07-04 00:00:00</td><td>The second episode of the new trilogy of Star Wars was much better than the first. He is much more gloomy eventful and full of the sense that soon the customary world will collapse ... Moreover it can be considered the most romantic film of the saga - speech of course about the love line of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala performed by Natalie Portman. It is not only very well developed but it also takes place mainly in very beautiful blooming locations which is generally uncommon for Star Wars. Even sad to realize that it is waiting for a tragic ending ... In all other respects the Clone Attack can be considered a good film. Excellent battles on light swords skirmishes long conversations and flights on space ships - all this is done very qualitatively and interestingly. There are a lot of really unexpected plot twists which will be appreciated not only by the fans of the universe but by all the rest. For example when a small dwarf Yoda takes a lightsaber in his hands and almost starts on an equal footing with the formidable Count Dooku perhaps everyone was surprised ... However in spite of this the second episode can not be put on the same level as the classical trilogy. And it's not even the quality of performance but the fact that those films evoked much more emotional response they had the notorious Star Wars magic which is practically absent in the first two prequels. However watching the Attack of the Clones is worth all fans of fiction - these films are shot too rarely.</td></tr><tr><td>BiiivAL</td><td>0121766</td><td>9</td><td>2018-07-05 00:00:00</td><td>May 19 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the Star Wars. It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out wrote books and stories collected facts and made legends and everything for the sake of one saga which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably almost every person leaving the hall could not convey or describe in words what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful sad tearful shocked faces slowly headed for the exit promising to come back and see this episode again. This is the chapter of history truly the most intense and the most powerful. It penetrates into the lungs not allowing to breathe touching hearts and souls. We are just spectators. But we can experience. And at some point there is only a doomed sigh realizing that there is no way out. Indeed the third episode is the most cruel and tragic. There is much more pain and despair in it than in any other part. Here the republic collapses like a house of cards turning into an empire the Jedi perish at the hands of their single minded and the face of Anakin Skywalker forever hides the black helmet of Darth Vader. And all this inspires horror the horror of hopelessness when you slowly begin to understand that all this is only part of the plan the way of a petty senator to a ruthless emperor where everyone is just a pawn in a huge game of the big world. And every word said accidentally becomes the key to this great puzzle which accompanies the imperial march. But when you realize it it's too late. I swear the faithfulness of your teachings whispers the future dark lord to his master with despair and devotion asking only one thing - to save her beloved. At this moment Anakin Skywalker perishes dies together with the republic along with the Jedi together with her beloved giving birth to Darth Vader - the future tyrant which inspires terror and fear driven by hatred and despair in the eyes of which something like love is reflected ... And the most terrible thing was that it was inevitable. The Jedi themselves dug themselves a pit while the enemy stood behind them alternately pushing them down. This is war. Order 66. The army of clones. Padme Anakin. Alone these errors are not so significant but together they form a whole madness and panic in one hour destroying everything that the galaxy has been working on for many millennia. Therefore here the absolute evil and absolute good unite in the struggle this cinema and consists of some contrasts. Good and bad the Jedi and the Sith Obi-Wan and Anakin the emperor and Yoda Anakin and Padme. Such a controversial character went to Hayden Cristian. In essence he plays two opposites in one body. Nobility and sincerity at the beginning and anger and hatred in the end. And all fear began which slowly grew into panic then into despair anger getting to hatred. It was thanks to fear that the emperor firmly grabbed Anakin's soul not wanting to let go of his new servant. The glitter of embittered eyes in which hatred for everything and the thirst for power breathe. It is difficult to imagine someone who could better cope with this task. Therefore there are no more words left than one: I believe. It's all over Anakin. I'm above you! The battle of Obi-Wan and Skywalker is what remains in memory forever. This is not just a battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives this is a battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives for each other's sake. Here the side and skills of each are determined. Obi-Wan (in the brilliant by the way performance of Evan McGregor) does not try to follow the easy ways to achieve his goals. He goes to Mustafar he understands with bitterness what is going on. Therefore this battle is not only with the darkness it is a battle with yourself with your feelings and attachments. Unlike Anakin Obi-Wan is firmly committed to duty goals order. For some reason he is sorry for the most in the end. A person who in any situation acted as correctly and not as easily. At the same time we see the battle of two other opposites. Yoda and the emperor. Here the battle goes for other concepts for democracy peace and freedom. The fate of the entire galaxy is being decided. And as the swords are crossed good and evil are constantly side by side weaving and maintaining the balance of power crossing swords but achieving different goals. But where did it start? Padme Amidala without knowing it herself is the center of the whole string and culmination that unfolds during these few hours. A tragic figure that unwittingly became the key to the empire from which they simply got rid of unnecessarily. Natalie Portman like no other fits into a gloomy sweep and the helpless panic that reigns around. Her heroine is touching and ardent but unable to change anything she is only an outside observer of the war and the collapse of the republic. Painful and sad ... Most of the attention of the film is given to Anakin whose fear and sweeping increasingly turns him into the ruler of the Sith. However about the persecution of General Grievous powerful battles and amazing planets also did not forget. This is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. Yes and whether to restrain feelings? After all this legend which will be remembered. Bravo George Lucas. The highest ball.</td></tr><tr><td>BiiivAL</td><td>1185834</td><td>8</td><td>2018-07-05 00:00:00</td><td>What can I say about the new chapters of the great saga of the Far-distant Galaxy? To say that it is amazing that it is exciting and that it is fascinating - means to say nothing. The series seemed to have poured new blood into the Star Wars. And now the fact that I was impressed with him: 1. Clones ... for the first time in the history of the series (including numerous comic books books games and individual stories) the clones showed LIVE! From now on these are not soulless faceless machines for murders. These are ordinary people just like you or me. They also think they experience they feel and feel fear. For the first time in the history of the series my heart bleeds when another soldier settles on the ground with a black hole in white mandororian armor. Each clone is like a brother and at the same time is incredibly unique. This is shown especially well in the series (it seems first but perhaps the memory changes me) where Master Yoda with a bunch of clones had to make his way to the ruler of no-remember-what-planet to conclude a contract before Darth Tiranus (Count Dooku in the common people). It is there that the great Yoda reveals to each of his brothers his uniqueness. 2. Music. Well ... what can I say. The music of John Williams is of course good. But ... it is a little outdated (in my case - fed up). In addition it absolutely does not approach the action which unfolds in the series. Kevin Kainer was able not only to create an atmosphere of what is happening. His compositions literally tell us what's happening on the screen perfectly fitting into the picture (although it would have been perfectly listened to without it). 3. Graphics. Many scold this series and full-length for the graphic component. I do not know about you but I liked it. And George Lucas too. In one of his interviews he said that he specifically decided to use just such a graphic style. 4. Humor. A good deal of sound humor is also there. If someone says that the droids joke flatly and in a way that is not funny then do not believe this person because most likely he does not have a sense of humor or he did not hear but learned about it from the stories of one deaf-mute (yes forgive me these people for I did not mean anything insulting). If many of the droid's phrases are simply ridiculous then some make you literally cry with laughter. 5. The plot. I'm delighted that I can finally see what happened during the clone war so I'll add it to this list. 6. Action. Neither in a fairy tale nor describe with a pen. Such brutal battle scenes you have never seen and camera work just blows the roof) Music adds effect. Bottom line: what do we get as a result? A grinding blend that is svezhakom in the saga. But the most important thing here is the mapping of clones. The number of Jedi here is quite understandable since this is the series of fighters in white armor. Honestly I would gladly have looked at all six episodes again if they were re-released in the same style.</td></tr><tr><td>BiiivAL</td><td>3896198</td><td>8</td><td>2018-06-05 00:00:00</td><td>Family cosmagogue</td></tr><tr><td>BiiivAL</td><td>4630562</td><td>8</td><td>2018-06-09 00:00:00</td><td>Blockbuster-soap opera with elements of comedy</td></tr><tr><td>billion_mucks</td><td>0105323</td><td>10</td><td>2007-11-26 00:00:00</td><td>Old Men Won't Cry- Scent of A Woman</td></tr><tr><td>billntoumos</td><td>3544112</td><td>9</td><td>2016-07-26 00:00:00</td><td>Surprisingly delightful</td></tr><tr><td>billygoat1071</td><td>1409024</td><td>7</td><td>2012-05-26 00:00:00</td><td>Bigger Imaginations</td></tr><tr><td>billygoata1071</td><td>1790864</td><td>7</td><td>2014-09-18 00:00:00</td><td>Compromises</td></tr><tr><td>bitcetc</td><td>0427944</td><td>8</td><td>2006-03-24 00:00:00</td><td>You'll need to inhale then exhale slowly and relax before plunging into the world of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) lobbyist and bag man for the Tobacco Industry.

It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you this film is not for everyone. Especially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless it is a MASTERPIECE. The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin respectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional depth that one could sympathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion.

One thing I that disappointed by was the lack of screen time for Steve Coogan and Owen Wilson or Octavius and Jedediah. In the first movie they stole the show. But in this movie they are underused like most of the others in the cast. Night at the Museum 2 has its funny parts but seems to lack the charm and fun of the first movie. It's a worthy sequel that meets the standards of the first movie but doesn't exceed them. You might want to wait for it's DVD/Blu-Ray release but seeing in theaters is good too.

Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX but the film is more touching than it is intense? and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane who is slightly bigger slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne? the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority?forget the Bane you saw in BATMAN &amp; ROBIN. Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine however that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.</td></tr><tr><td>gogoschka-1</td><td>0099685</td><td>10</td><td>2013-12-17 00:00:00</td><td>In one word: perfection</td></tr><tr><td>Gordon-11</td><td>0980970</td><td>10</td><td>2010-12-02 00:00:00</td><td>This film is about the Pevensies and their cousin entering Narnia again in order to help Prince Caspian gather all seven swords of the lords to fight against dark forces.</td></tr><tr><td>GrantCAGE</td><td>0107614</td><td>9</td><td>2001-08-18 00:00:00</td><td>I saw this movie at the cinema in 1993 and thought it was fantastic!

Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films at least the moments with him in it are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen.

In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either do you? What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere full of mystery surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's) but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it you have to make sure you get the director's cut. The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever did an excellent job. Together with the images the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot. Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it. I can really recommend this movie to everyone but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.</td></tr><tr><td>pilby</td><td>0113670</td><td>0</td><td>2000-07-09 00:00:00</td><td>Wonderful material for the heart ...</td></tr><tr><td>pinkled5</td><td>1670345</td><td>6</td><td>2013-06-07 00:00:00</td><td>Watchable but lacks depth &amp; substance</td></tr><tr><td>pipoulefr</td><td>816692</td><td>10</td><td>2014-11-05 00:00:00</td><td>Nolan's masterpiece one of the best sci-fi movie</td></tr><tr><td>poikkeus</td><td>0875025</td><td>8</td><td>2007-02-28 00:00:00</td><td>Thrilling entertainment risk</td></tr><tr><td>pololmbob</td><td>1190080</td><td>7</td><td>2009-11-15 00:00:00</td><td>It's the end of the world not anybody's career</td></tr><tr><td>polsixe</td><td>0870967</td><td>6</td><td>2008-01-17 00:00:00</td><td>All in all a straightforward message movie well played.</td></tr><tr><td>poopville</td><td>3778644</td><td>7</td><td>2018-08-06 00:00:00</td><td>So I am of the generation who got to experience Star Wars feom the beginning. Standing in a crazy ling line literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. Totally unaware I was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood early teens and once again as an adult. And all these years later able to share this fandom with my own son. I liked Solo. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that I associate with Stat Wars. The world and characters felt right. It showed us some cool new things about life in that world living under the Empire. The amazing cityscapes of Corellia... It felt similar to me to Rogue One. Modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic Star Wars world. Anyway I just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom fans on here. I don't really understand it. I have liked something about every Star Wars movie there has been. Some are better than others. There are weaker moments in every one to be sure. But none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there. Solo is good and worth your time if you like Star Wars. Just one fan's opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>Pozzible_Movie_Critic</td><td>1440129</td><td>8</td><td>2012-03-21 00:00:00</td><td>Definition of a guilty pleasure</td></tr><tr><td>Prashast_Singh</td><td>2381249</td><td>10</td><td>2018-10-27 00:00:00</td><td>A solid entry in the MI series; a stunning action movie.</td></tr><tr><td>qqh-57167</td><td>2557478</td><td>3</td><td>2018-10-20 00:00:00</td><td>I Suppose There Isn't Much Room To Criticize This Film</td></tr><tr><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0021749</td><td>10</td><td>2004-09-12 00:00:00</td><td>Lady and the Tramp before animation and at the start of talkies- one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed</td></tr><tr><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0073486</td><td>10</td><td>2000-04-15 00:00:00</td><td>Best film of its era</td></tr><tr><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0317705</td><td>10</td><td>2004-11-05 00:00:00</td><td>My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film</td></tr><tr><td>randywwe412</td><td>0803096</td><td>10</td><td>2016-05-19 00:00:00</td><td>A great Fantasy flick</td></tr><tr><td>rayclister</td><td>0795421</td><td>7</td><td>2008-07-10 00:00:00</td><td>James Bond needs singing lessons!</td></tr><tr><td>reallyevilboy</td><td>2315152</td><td>10</td><td>2014-08-28 00:00:00</td><td>I still look at this movie just the front cover a year after I have seen it and I feel a little tear roll down my cheek.</td></tr><tr><td>realtab</td><td>3460252</td><td>7</td><td>2015-12-31 00:00:00</td><td>Don't believe the 1's and 2's or the 9's and 10's</td></tr><tr><td>rgregsheppard</td><td>6924650</td><td>8</td><td>2019-12-05 00:00:00</td><td>A bit Hollywood but a good movie.

At first Culkin loves the situation but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house. However Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack. Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay. This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays only makes it that much more special. All the performers do well and in the end the film also does. 4 stars out of 5.</td></tr><tr><td>The_Light_Triton</td><td>0114709</td><td>8</td><td>2009-01-22 00:00:00</td><td>Popular movies are coming out every month and some of them have such hype that games are made for them.

In this movie Megan Fox is no longer to be seen but we are gifted with a beautiful Rosie Huntington-Whiteley playing along side Shia LaBeouf. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. just like the first two it combines an action/love/comedy attribute. The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are going on. I like how they've taken something that has actually happened like the moon landing and have put there own twist on what actually was happening. this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life.</td></tr><tr><td>thejoshl</td><td>1457767</td><td>9</td><td>2013-07-17 00:00:00</td><td>With virtually no sex no gore and no cursing The Conjuring earns its R-rating on scares alone.</td></tr><tr><td>TheKing87</td><td>5580390</td><td>10</td><td>2018-06-05 00:00:00</td><td>Many people misunderstood this movie!

I don't think any sane person watching this movie would take this seriously. This is a comedy for crying out loud made to make us laugh!  I thought Black was fine in this movie. Sure maybe his character is a little one-note with his proclamations of rock on and stick it to the man but Black somehow manages to do it over and over without being boring. He's unbelievably energetic AND versatile delivering these same things in different ways each time that prevent the movie from getting into a rut. I think it's safe to say that only Black himself could have made this role work so well.</td></tr><tr><td>xchintu</td><td>7880466</td><td>10</td><td>2018-04-18 00:00:00</td><td>One of the best conan movie</td></tr><tr><td>yancyscott1</td><td>0081505</td><td>9</td><td>2007-04-09 00:00:00</td><td>timeless terror</td></tr><tr><td>yeolit</td><td>2283336</td><td>8</td><td>2019-07-27 00:00:00</td><td>I watched almost all if not all of the past instalments feels pretty M.I.B-ish to me though at some points it was kind of cliched.</td></tr><tr><td>yfguitarist</td><td>1148204</td><td>9</td><td>2009-07-22 00:00:00</td><td>Remarkably well-acted darkly humorous and effectively disturbing</td></tr><tr><td>YJLcool</td><td>1638002</td><td>7</td><td>2014-11-11 00:00:00</td><td>A heartfelt sincere romantic drama comedy film</td></tr><tr><td>ymyuseda</td><td>1206885</td><td>9</td><td>2019-09-18 00:00:00</td><td>Stallone Has Truly Done It Again</td></tr><tr><td>ymyuseda</td><td>4777008</td><td>7</td><td>2019-10-17 00:00:00</td><td>Good But Not Amazing</td></tr><tr><td>ymyuseda</td><td>7668870</td><td>8</td><td>2018-09-26 00:00:00</td><td>Excellent Actor And Actrees In This Film</td></tr><tr><td>yoggwork</td><td>6788942</td><td>8</td><td>2019-02-18 00:00:00</td><td>what a teenagers movie should be</td></tr><tr><td>yongfilmcritic</td><td>1663202</td><td>10</td><td>2019-01-17 00:00:00</td><td>A milestone in cinematography.</td></tr><tr><td>zde-03245</td><td>2488496</td><td>1</td><td>2016-12-11 00:00:00</td><td>I do not have a hard time placing this film. On one side it's so typically hollywoodish - it's a super-production with Star Wars-related content that would make it probably to many Fan film festivals. It's very conventional in its Sunday morning TV message and the morality tale that it tells is quite conventional and of course we know the end of the story either because we have watched Star Wars or because we have seen enough films from Hollywood or for both reasons. On the other side it's a film by JJ Abrams so there is a dose of mainstream story-telling and inexplicable plot developments in its characters. The special effects are 100% created for the movie and uninspired. So it's the story of Episode IV without any twists. What makes it worse are elements of fan fiction in the story telling distracted (but not awful) acting from Leia Rey and others and the computer-generated special effects which succeed to create a level of thrill to a story. Did we need this story and episode? At this level of amateurishness the answer is no.</td></tr><tr><td>ZeroCorpse-1</td><td>0417741</td><td>6</td><td>2009-07-15 00:00:00</td><td>All the least important parts of the book in movie form.</td></tr><tr><td>ziodalcio</td><td>0198781</td><td>10</td><td>2019-02-07 00:00:00</td><td>I don't know how many times I have watched this movie but it always makes me laugh like it's the first time I see it.
